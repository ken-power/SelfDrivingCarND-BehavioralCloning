# Project: Behavioral Cloning

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) program. The goal of this project is to clone driving behavior using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).


## The Project
This project has the following requirements:

* Use a simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

The written report is in the file [writeup.md](writeup.md).

The video (uploaded to YouTube) was created from the center camera perspective:

This animated GIF shows an extract of the car driving autonomously around the track. Videos of the car completing a full lap are below.

This video (hosted on YouTube) is sped up 30x and shows the car driving autonomously for a full lap around the track:

This is the same video (hosted on YouTube) at normal speed:
